# AI-Powered Incident Triage Assistant

## Project Overview

This project implements an **AI-Native ITSM (IT Service Management) system** that automatically triages IT incidents using intelligent categorization and priority assignment. The system processes incoming incident reports and applies AI-driven logic to suggest severity levels, categories, and recommended actions to help IT support teams respond more efficiently.

**Assignment Choice**: Assignment 1 - AI-Powered Incident Triage Assistant  
**Modules Implemented**: Core AI Logic, Data Persistence, Backend Event Ingestion API

## Technology Stack Justification

| Component | Technology | Justification |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Backend Framework** | Java 21  + Spring Boot 3.5 | Industry standard for enterprise applications, excellent for REST APIs, dependency injection, and comprehensive ecosystem |
| **Database** | H2 (Development) / PostgreSQL (Production) | H2 for easy setup and testing, PostgreSQL for production scalability |
| **Build Tool** | Maven | Standard Java build tool with excellent dependency management |
| **Data Access** | Spring Data JPA | Simplifies database operations with powerful repository abstractions |
| **Validation** | Spring Boot Validation | Built-in validation framework for request data |

## Core Functionality Overview

### User Journey
1. **Incident Submission**: IT staff submit incident reports via REST API with title, description, and affected service
2. **AI Processing**: System applies rule-based AI logic to analyze incident content
3. **Intelligent Categorization**: AI assigns severity (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW), category (DATABASE/NETWORK/APPLICATION/INFRASTRUCTURE), and suggested actions
4. **Data Persistence**: Processed incidents stored in database with original data + AI insights
5. **Retrieval & Analytics**: Various endpoints provide filtered access and statistical insights

### AI Logic Implementation

**Current Implementation**: Rule-based AI system using keyword analysis and pattern matching
**Future Ready**: Architecture designed for seamless LLM integration

**Important Note**: I implemented a rule-based AI for augmentation. This can be replaced by an external LLM (e.g., OpenAI API) by updating AITriageService.

The current AI logic analyzes incident text using:
- **Severity Classification**: Keywords like "down", "outage", "critical" → HIGH severity
- **Category Detection**: "database", "network", "server" → Appropriate category assignment  
- **Action Recommendation**: Based on severity and category combination

                       └─────────────────┘
```

### Database Schema Design

**Incident Entity** (`incidents` table):
```sql
CREATE TABLE incidents (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description VARCHAR(1000),
    affected_service VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    ai_severity VARCHAR(50),        -- AI-generated
    ai_category VARCHAR(50),        -- AI-generated  
    ai_suggested_action VARCHAR(500), -- AI-generated
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

**Design Rationale**:
- Simple, normalized structure for easy querying
- Separate AI-generated fields for clear distinction
- Timestamp for temporal analysis and filtering

### API Design

**RESTful Endpoints**:

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Request/Response |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| POST | `/api/incidents` | Create new incident | `IncidentRequest` → `IncidentResponse` |
| GET | `/api/incidents` | Get all incidents | → `List<IncidentResponse>` |
| GET | `/api/incidents/{id}` | Get incident by ID | → `IncidentResponse` |
| GET | `/api/incidents/severity/{severity}` | Filter by severity | → `List<IncidentResponse>` |
| GET | `/api/incidents/category/{category}` | Filter by category | → `List<IncidentResponse>` |
| GET | `/api/incidents/statistics` | Get AI analytics | → `Map<String, Long>` |
| GET | `/api/incidents/search` | Advanced search | Query params → `List<IncidentResponse>` |

**Request/Response Format**:
```json
// POST /api/incidents - Request
{
    "title": "Database connection timeout",
    "description": "Users cannot connect to production database",
    "affectedService": "user-authentication-service"
}

// Response with AI insights
{
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Database connection timeout", 
    "description": "Users cannot connect to production database",
    "affectedService": "user-authentication-service",
    "aiSeverity": "MEDIUM",
    "aiCategory": "DATABASE", 
    "aiSuggestedAction": "Assign to appropriate team within 2 hours",
    "createdAt": "2025-08-30T12:09:00"
}
```

### Module Selection Rationale

**Implemented Modules**:
1. **Core AI Logic** - Essential for demonstrating AI-native capabilities
2. **Data Persistence** - Required for any production system  
3. **Backend Event Ingestion API** - Chosen over Frontend Dashboard to focus on backend Java expertise

**Integration Strategy for Unimplemented Modules**:
- **Frontend Dashboard**: Would consume existing REST APIs, display incidents in sortable tables, provide real-time statistics dashboard
- **Additional AI Modules**: Current AITriageService can be extended with correlation logic, trend analysis, or external LLM integration

## Prompt Engineering & AI Assistant Strategy

### Prompt Engineering Techniques Used

1.  **Specificity & Context**: Always provided specific context about
    the assignment requirements, Java version, and Spring Boot features
    needed

2.  **Iterative Refinement**: Started with broad architecture questions,
    then refined with specific implementation details

3.  **Example-Driven Prompts**: Provided sample data structures and
    expected outputs to get more relevant responses

4.  **Best Practice Queries**: Asked specifically about Java/Spring Boot
    best practices to ensure professional code quality

### AI Assistant Rules/Templates Strategy

**Conceptual Rules for Larger Projects**:

```yaml
# Java Spring Boot Project Rules
coding_standards:
  - Use Java 21+ features where appropriate
  - Follow Spring Boot convention over configuration
  - Implement proper exception handling with @ControllerAdvice
  - Use DTOs for API contracts, entities for persistence
  - Apply validation at controller level with @Valid

architecture_patterns:
  - Separate concerns: Controller → Service → Repository
  - Use dependency injection with constructor injection
  - Implement transaction management with @Transactional
  - Design for testability with interface abstractions

ai_integration_template:
  - Isolate AI logic in dedicated service classes
  - Design for easy switching between rule-based and ML models  
  - Implement strategy pattern for algorithm selection
  - Use configuration properties for AI model settings
```

**Template Usage Example**:
For larger projects, I would create IntelliJ Live Templates for common patterns:
```java
// Template: spring-service-method
@Transactional
public $ReturnType$ $methodName$($ParamType$ $paramName$) {
    try {
        // Implementation here
        return $result$;
    } catch (Exception e) {
        log.error("Error in {}: {}", "$methodName$", e.getMessage());
        throw new ServiceException("Failed to $operation$", e);
    }
}
```

## Testing & Validation
